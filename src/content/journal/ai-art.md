The conversation around AI-generated imagery tends to collapse into binary camps: either it's the death of art or the dawn of a new creative age. Both positions miss what's actually interesting about the moment we're in.

What makes a piece of art valuable has never been purely about the artifact. It's about the decisions behind it — what to include, what to leave out, what feeling to chase. A painter staring at a blank canvas and an art director staring at a blank brief are engaged in the same fundamental act: making choices that carry meaning.

## The Problem of Effortlessness

When a tool makes creation effortless, it doesn't eliminate creativity — it relocates it. Photography didn't kill painting. Synthesizers didn't kill live music. But each new tool did force a reckoning with what we actually value in the creative process.

The discomfort many designers feel around AI image generation isn't really about job security, though that's a legitimate concern. It's about the suspicion that if anyone can produce a polished image in seconds, then polish itself was never the point. And that's a confrontation worth having.

## Craft as Communication

The hours spent kerning type, adjusting color relationships, or refining a composition aren't just labor — they're a form of communication. They tell the viewer, "Someone cared enough to get this right." That signal of care is part of what makes design effective. It builds trust.

AI can replicate the surface of craft. It cannot replicate the intention behind it. A logo generated in Midjourney might look competent, but it wasn't shaped by hours of conversation about what a brand stands for. It wasn't iterated through rounds of feedback that sharpened the idea. The artifact might look similar. The artifact is not the work.

## Where This Goes

The designers who will thrive aren't the ones who refuse to engage with these tools, nor the ones who delegate their thinking to them. They're the ones who understand that tools are only as good as the questions you bring to them.

The real creative act has always been asking the right question. That hasn't changed. The tools for answering it just got faster.
